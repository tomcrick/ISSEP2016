----------- Review -----------
Honestly, I am a bit uncertain how to review your paper. First and most of all, it is an excellent reading and I really appreciate I have had a chance to read it - I learned a lot, especially as a foreigner currently living in England and being the leading developer of the programming intervension for Years 5 and 6 in an ambitious project sponsored by the government. Plus, as my own country is only a bit bigger than yours (I mean Wales, not the whole UK # ) I find myself properly qualified for estimating how much could your experience be `transferable' to other countries. And here I have two things to say:

#	I deeply appreciate the thorough form of presenting your story to a non-UK reader: you do not anticipate any special knowledge of the English and British system(s) of education.
#	I am ready to accept your position of the "prospective replicable case study" but only up to some 75% - there were some parts in 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 where I started asking myself whether it was all really valuable information for the ISSEP audience - a bit too much political, I would say. Sometimes it was easier for me to consider it as an excellent "country report" at an OECD or UNESCO event#

My main concern is this: when reading your paper (and as I said - I enjoyed it a lot!) I was all the time hoping to learn more about the Technocamps' vision of the modern computing content, your main leading "design principles", your understanding of developmentally appropriate and productive "programming component" of computing# I was eager to learn a little bit more about what is the "big picture" of your modern computing and modern programming, what are your main pedagogical strategies in this context etc.
Well, obviously you are knowledgeable author(s), so you may have very good reasons why it should stay as it is. I only want to suggest to consider the following: Would it be possible to make chapters 3 and 4 a bit shorter and make use of the space earned in that way (some 2 pages?) to focus more on Technocamps' vision of modern computing (with strong programming) for every pupil?

Anyhow, thank you for this exciting report.

----------- Review -----------
This paper gives a very thorough country report on Wales. There is not much to add to the paper and the content. The language is excellent, the literature review is adequate. It is exactly what the category says -- a country report.

However, I am afraid that the readers will not find it too interesting. In particular as the paper mostly concentrates on parties (and policy makers) engaged in teaching CS. There is not much on curriculum development and application, and on content comparison with the other countries. Consequently I am not highly recommending publishing of this paper.

TITLE: A National Engagement Model for Developing Computer Science Education in Wales
AUTHORS: Tom Crick and Faron Moller


----------- Review -----------
The paper is very well written and includes some political aspects concerning cs courses. The authors present the activities of a university-based outreach programme called Technocamp. The description aims to provide information for others countries or states to replicate similar activities in order to integrate CS education and digital competences.
As I said the report is very well written and provides a lot of useful information. There is a very good comparison with other countries and states, I would have liked to see some information also about CSTA and how the USA initiatives differ from UK's ones.
There are some commonalities with NZ case study and the historical approach of Sweden. Other contributions in these special issue might help the authors to make their report more critical:
